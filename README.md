# The T List
A visual map spotlighting crowd-sourced reviews to improve access to trans-affirming care through aggregated data. Users can see reviews at an existing location (visually marked by a pin). If reviews don't exist yet at a location, users can add a new review by placing a pin on the map and then submitting the review form below.
