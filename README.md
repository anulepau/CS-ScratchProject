# The T List
The T-List offers a visual platform spotlighting crowd-sourced reviews to improve access to trans-affirming care through aggregated data. Users can read reviews in their area marked by a location pin. If reviews don't exist at a location, users can add a new review there by placing a pin on the map, and then posting to the review form below.
